# D2LimitAHK
Displays a timer when you activate a NetLimiter hotkey.
This is done very bad but people kept asking for it. I'm unsure if it works with function keys or any others like them. 

- You need AutoHotKey 1.1 installed, you can download it [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe).
- Adjust the script to your hotkeys by editing lines 11-16 which are your limit hotkeys in order of 3074 DL, 30000, 7500, 27000, Full Game and 3074 UL (order doesn't actually matter).
- You also need to edit lines 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90 with the same hotkeys without the control aspect.
- Control + 0 is Game Pauser which is inbuilt, edit line 17 and 95 to change that hotkey.
